Using the powerful [Eleventy Image plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/), we have three ways to optimize images: <a href="#html-transform">HTML Transform</a>, <a href="#markdown-syntax">Markdown syntax</a>, and <a href="#nunjucks-shortcodes">Nunjucks shortcodes</a>.

<a name="html-transform"></a>
## HTML Transform

Transforms any `<img>` or `<picture>` tags in HTML files as a post-processing step. Find the default settings directly in `eleventy.config.js`.

```html
<img src="./co-located-image.jpg" alt="alt text">
<img src="/assets/images/absolute-path-image.jpg" alt="alt text">
```

We can pass in overrides for every instance and use attributes. By default all images are set to be lazy loaded, but we can override this by directly setting `loading="eager"` and `decoding="sync" `on the `<img>` element.

Another thing to note is the  `widths: ['auto']` setting, which by default only includes the original size image. We can set the dedicated `widths` to be used by adding `eleventy:widths="800,1200"` on the element. For images with [Markdown syntax](/blog/post-with-an-image/#markdown-syntax), I set fixed `widths` so we don't need to set a value on every instance.

`sizes` defaults to `auto`, which is applied to all lazy loading images. For eager-loading images, the value is equivalent to `100vw` See: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/8008. We can _still_ overwrite this, by setting the `sizes` attribute directly on the `<img>` element, with something specific like `sizes="(max-width: 615px) 50vw, 100vw"`.

```html
<img src="./co-located-image.jpg" alt="alt text" eleventy:widths="200,600" loading="eager" decoding="sync">
```

<img src="./asturias-1.jpg" alt="A picturesque valley showcasing majestic mountains and lush forests, creating a serene and captivating landscape" eleventy:widths="200,600" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 50vw, 100vw" loading="eager" decoding="sync">

**Extra benefit:** we can use both relative and absolute image sources.
One downside is that it comes with a higher build cost due to the post-processing step.

## Markdown syntax

This also uses [Image HTML Transform ](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#html-transform).
The markdown sytnax for images creates the `<img>` element the plugin is looking for, and then transforms it to the `<picture>` element (if more than one format is set).

In `src/_config/plugins/markdown.js` I customized the Markdown rendering for images slightly. What normally would become a `title` attribute is used to create the caption (`<figcaption>` within a `<figure>` element). Note that I set a fixed `widths` value instead of `auto` as the default.

```markdown
![alt text](/path/to/image 'caption text')
![Close-up...](/assets/images/gallery/asturias-4.jpg) 'I used a portrait lens for this one'
```

![Close-up with unfocused background of a vibrant large blue butterfly gracefully perched on a delicate flower amidst lush green gras](/assets/images/gallery/asturias-4.jpg 'I used a portrait lens for this one')

We can also add custom attributes here ([Kudos to Aleksandr](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/eleventy-image-transform/)), to overwrite the default `widths`, have the image eagerly loaded, or add a `class` attribute, etc.

```markdown
![alt text](/path/to/image){attrs}
![Close-up...](/assets/images/gallery/asturias-2.jpg){loading="eager" decoding="sync" eleventy:widths="400" class="grayscale"}
```

## Nunjucks shortcodes

### Positional parameters Shortcode

The positional parameters shortcode is the legacy approach and requires the arguments to be **passed in the correct order**.

The most basic version contains only the path to the image.

{% raw %}

```jinja2
{% image "path to image" %}
```

{% endraw %}

All skipped parameters are set to their default values: an empty string if no `alt` text is passed, `loading = 'lazy'`, the `<picture>` element gets its set of images from the default `widths=[650,960,1400]` and compares to a condition of `sizes="auto"`, formats are `['avif', 'webp', 'jpeg']`.

We can pass in manually all the conditions, and add `null` to skip. The arguments include classes for the outer container ( `<picture>` or `<figure>` element), and for the `<img>` element.

{% raw %}

```jinja2
{% image "path to image", "alt text", "caption text", "eager", "container class names", "img class names", [200, 400], "(min-width:30em) 50vw, 100vw", ['webp', 'jpeg'] %}
{% image "path to image", "alt text", null, "eager" %}
```

{% endraw %}

{% image "/assets/images/gallery/asturias-3.jpg", "A traditional Asturian village with it's raised granaries, surrounded by lush green hills and mountains", "An example for the positional parameters shortcode.", "lazy", "text-center", "grayscale", [200, 400], "(min-width:30em) 50vw, 100vw",  ['webp', 'jpeg'] %}

**Example:** predefine `widths` and `sizes` using Nunjuck's `set` tag or front matter fields, and dynamically get the image path, like I do in the "[Built with](/blog/built-with/)" template.

{% raw %}

```jinja2
{% set widths = [400, 520] %}
{% set sizes = '(max-width: 615px) 50vw, 100vw' %}

{% image "/assets/images/screenshots/" + site.filename + ".jpg", site.name, null, "lazy", null, null, widths, sizes %}
```

{% endraw %}

### Named Parameters Shortcode

Remembering the order of the arguments is a bit of a pain, so I added a second shortcode: `imageKeys`.

This shortcode allows us to specify parameters in any order or only include the ones we need to customize. We need to pass the parameters as a `JSON` object with the key-value pairs.

{% raw %}

```jinja2
{% imageKeys {
  "src": "/assets/images/gallery/asturias-3.jpg",
  "alt": "A traditional Asturian village with it's raised granaries, surrounded by lush green hills and mountains",
  "caption": "An example for the named parameters shortcode.",
  "loading": "lazy",
  "containerClass": "text-center",
  "imageClass": "grayscale",
  "widths": [200, 400],
  "sizes": "(min-width:30em) 50vw, 100vw",
  "formats": ["webp", "jpeg"]
} %}
```

{% endraw %}

{% imageKeys {
  "src": "/assets/images/gallery/asturias-3.jpg",
  "alt": "A traditional Asturian village with it's raised granaries, surrounded by lush green hills and mountains",
  "caption": "An example for the named parameters shortcode.",
  "loading": "lazy",
  "containerClass": "text-center",
  "imageClass": "grayscale",
  "widths": [200, 400],
  "sizes": "(min-width:30em) 50vw, 100vw",
  "formats": ["webp", "jpeg"]
} %}

**Example:** if we only need to customize `alt` text and `sizes`:

{% raw %}

```jinja2
{% imageKeys {
  "sizes": '(min-width:30em) 50vw, 100vw',
  "alt": "A traditional Asturian village with it's raised granaries, surrounded by lush green hills and mountains",
  "src": "/assets/images/photo.jpg"
} %}
```

{% endraw %}

The shortcodes are defined in `src/_config/shortcodes/image.js`. They also set `slot="image"` on their container element, so they can be used with any WebC component that contains a `<slot name="image"></slot>`, see `src/_includes/webc/custom-card.web` for example.

Since we are using them alongside the <a href="#html-transform">Image HTML Transform</a> method, the shortcodes add `eleventy:ignore` to the `<img>` attributes so the images arenâ€™t processed twice.

## Comparing Shortcode and HTML Transform

The shortcode can be much terser than the HTML syntax, while the HTML syntax is more readable and has a well known structure.

**These two approaches produce (almost) the same output:**

{% raw %}

```jinja2
{% image image, alt or "", credit, "eager", "feature", "grayscale" %}

<figure class="feature">
  <img src="{{ image }}" alt="{{ alt or '' }}" loading="eager" decoding="sync" class="grayscale">
  {% if credit %}
    <figcaption>{{ credit }}</figcaption>
  {% endif %}
</figure>
```

{% endraw %}

{% set image = '/assets/images/gallery/asturias-1.jpg' %}
{% set alt = 'A picturesque valley showcasing majestic mountains and lush forests, creating a serene and captivating landscape' %}

{% set credits = ['Example image using the positional shortcode', 'Example image using the HTML syntax'] %}

{% for credit in credits %}
  {% if loop.index == 1 %}
    {% image image, alt or "", credit, "eager", "feature", "grayscale" %}
  {% else %}
    <figure class="feature">
      <img src="{{ image }}" alt="{{ alt or '' }}" loading="eager" decoding="sync" class="grayscale">
      {% if credit %}
        <figcaption>{{ credit }}</figcaption>
      {% endif %}
    </figure>
  {% endif %}

{% endfor %}
