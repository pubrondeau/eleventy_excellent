title: Card
---

<p>
  Previous to version 3, the card component was a Nunjucks include. There are a number of things that had to
  be set before being able to use it, like the level of the heading or whether tags shall be displayed.
  <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/">WebC</a>
  makes this easier, as you can now use the custom element and opt in to the different slots.
</p>

<h3>Available slots:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>image</code>: has <code>slot="image"</code> on the
    container (<code>picture</code> or <code>figure</code>) by default)
  </li>
  <li><code>headline</code>: display the card's main title</li>
  <li>
    <code>date</code> and <code>tag</code>: Grouped within the classes <code>meta</code> and <code>cluster</code> for date and tagging
    information
  </li>
  <li><code>content</code></li>
  <li><code>footer</code>: for links or whatever footer information</li>
</ul>

<p>I added some <strong>variants</strong>, avaliable via attribute selectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>img-square</code>: Enforces a square aspect ratio for images</li>
  <li><code>clickable</code>: Makes the whole card clickable</li>
  <li><code>no-padding</code>: Removes padding and background modifications</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code>{% raw %}<!--prettier-ignore-->&lt;custom-card&gt;
{% image "path-to-img", "alt-text" %}
&lt;span slot="date"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span slot="tag" class="button"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h2 slot="headline"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p slot="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer slot="footer"&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/custom-card&gt;
{% endraw %}</code></pre>
